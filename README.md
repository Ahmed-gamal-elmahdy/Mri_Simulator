# Mri Simulator

## Description
An application for simulating Different MRI Sequences and Displaying useful Data for MRI Images.

## Features
1. Navigate a Shepp-logan MRI Phantom by:
   * Adjusting Brightness for better visualization.
   * Clicking the phantom to display the Tissue Properties of certain Parts.
   * Changing the weight of the phantom to T1, T2 OR SD.
   * Selecting Different Phantom Sizes.

3. Apply different MRI sequences to the Phantom and reconstruct it <br> in real time.
   * Choose Sampling Method (Cartesian, Radial, Spiral)
   * adjust Sampling Parameters (number of Spirals, Rounds / Number of lines) <br><br>
